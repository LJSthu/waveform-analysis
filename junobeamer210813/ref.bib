	abstract = {Detailed measurements of Hamamatsu R5912 photomultiplier signals are presented, including the single photoelectron charge response, waveform shape, nonlinearity, saturation, overshoot, oscillation, prepulsing, and afterpulsing. The results were used to build a detailed model of the PMT signal characteristics over a wide range of light intensities. Including the PMT model in simulated Daya Bay particle interactions shows no significant systematic effects that are detrimental to the experimental sensitivity.},

	abstract = {A visualization method based on Unity engine is proposed for the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) experiment. The method has been applied in development of a new event display tool named ELAINA (Event Live Animation with unIty for Neutrino Analysis), which provides an intuitive way for users to observe the detector geometry, to tune the reconstruction algorithm and to analyze the physics events. In comparison with the traditional ROOT-based event display, ELAINA provides better visual effects with the Unity engine. It is developed independently of the JUNO offline software but shares the same detector description and event data model in JUNO offline with interfaces. Users can easily download and run the event display on their local computers with different operation systems.},
