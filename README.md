#Introduction
This branch is used for compare the zaq rgs and xdc rgs.

result is in directory `compare`


1. Create directory `result` and `waveform` in a rational place to store analysis results and simulated waveforms
2. To test methods, in command line, run (take `fbmp` method as an example)
   ```
   make method=fbmp
   ```
   Noted: try option `-n` first to avoid mistake
3. To draw `vs-` pictures, in command line, run 
   ```
   make vs
   ```
   Noted: try option `-n` first to avoid mistake
4. Figures in Note are all generated by `latexdemo.ipynb` and `vs.py`
