	abstract = {Detailed measurements of Hamamatsu R5912 photomultiplier signals are presented, including the single photoelectron charge response, waveform shape, nonlinearity, saturation, overshoot, oscillation, prepulsing, and afterpulsing. The results were used to build a detailed model of the PMT signal characteristics over a wide range of light intensities. Including the PMT model in simulated Daya Bay particle interactions shows no significant systematic effects that are detrimental to the experimental sensitivity.},

	abstract = {A low-complexity recursive procedure is presented for minimum mean squared error (MMSE) estimation in linear regression models. A Gaussian mixture is chosen as the prior on the unknown parameter vector. The algorithm returns both an approximate MMSE estimate of the parameter vector and a set of high posterior probability mixing parameters. Emphasis is given to the case of a sparse parameter vector. Numerical simulations demonstrate estimation performance and illustrate the distinctions between MMSE estimation and MAP model selection. The set of high probability mixing parameters not only provides MAP basis selection, but also yields relative probabilities that reveal potential ambiguity in the sparse model.},
