Usage:
For training network model : make model
    make [TrainFileNo=fileno] [TrainDataDir=/path/to/traindata/dir/] [traindata_name_prefix=prefix] [NetStorageDir=/path/to/network/storage/dir] [MaxSet=max_train_set_number] model
        traindata_name_prefix: traindata file name shoud obey "{prefix}*.h5", for example abtraining-0.h5, "abtraining-" is the prefix
        TrainFileNo: "[x,y,...]" for example, [0] or [0,1,3] or [2,3,4,5] or simply [`seq -s , 2 5`]. Default * (match for all existing fileno).
        TrainDataDir: path to traindata directory. The "/" at the end is essential.
        max_train_set_number: maxium waveform training set number. If set to 0, all waveform will be used. Default 100000.
        NetStorageWorkDir: path to PreProcess traindata and network storage directory. The "/" at the end is essential.
	example: make FileNo=[`seq -s , 0 7`] TrainDataDir=dataset/jinp/
    traindata_name_prefix=abtraining- model

For using network model to conduct waveform analysis : make Analysis
    make [TestFileNo=fileno] [TestDataDir=/path/to/traindata/dir/] [testdata_name_prefix=prefix] [NetStorageStore=/path/to/network/dir] [ResultStorageDir=/path/to/result/dir] Analysis
        testdata_name_prefix: testdata file name shoud obey "{prefix}*.h5", for example zinc-problem-0.h5, "zinc-problem-" is the prefix
        TestFileNo: "[x,y,...]" for example, [0] or [0,1,3] or [2,3,4,5] or simply [`seq -s , 2 5`]. Default * (match for all existing fileno).
        TestDataDir: path to testdata directory. The "/" at the end is essential.
        NetStore: path to trained network storage directory, typically have a name contains "Network_Models_" and traindata_name_prefix, and the dir contains network parameters file "_epoch*_loss*.npz" and a .Training_finished file. The "/" at the end is essential.
        ResultDir: path to PreProcess testdata and prediction result storage directory. The "/" at the end is essential.

Please make sure you have rwx access to current dir, read access to TrainDataDir, and rw access to NetWorkDir and ResultDir!
