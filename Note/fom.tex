Electronics noise is the primary existing bothersome factor for waveform analysis. The first figure of merit is the residual sum of squares (RSS, square of L2 distances) between the waveform without noise recorded in simulation and the waveform derived from reconstructed charge $\hat{q}$ as well as SPE, which is formula \eqref{eq:rss}. It can show the extent to which the reconstructed charge $\hat{q}$ reserved and filtered the original waveform information. But to some extent, RSS is not very sensitive to the time distribution of PEs, which is explained below. 

\begin{equation}
    D_r = \mathrm{RSS}(w(t), \hat{q} \otimes V_\mathrm{PE}(t)) \label{eq:rss}
\end{equation}

In many cases, the reconstruction result and truth can both be regarded as sampling results from some form of probability distribution. Here we introduce Wasserstein distance as the second figure of merit that can contribute to the improvement of timing resolution. 

Suppose $P(X)$ and $Q(X)$ are 2 probability density functions of random variable $X$. There are many ways to measure the difference (distance) between $P(X)$ and $Q(X)$: 

\begin{minipage}{.3\textwidth}
\begin{align*}
    L_{1} &= \int|p-q| \ud t \\
    L_{2} &= \int(p-q)^{2} \ud t \\
    \chi^{2} &= \int\frac{(p-q)^{2}}{q} \ud t \\
    \cdots
\end{align*}
\end{minipage}

\end{figure}
\end{minipage}

But these distances have certain shortcomings. First, they cannot compare a discrete distribution with a continuous distribution. Second, they are not sensitive to timing: as the graph shows, the L2 distances, square root of RSS, between the distribution of $a,b_{1}$ and $a,b_{2}$ are both 0.25, but the shape of the $b_{1}$ and $b_{2}$ distribution is very different (see figure~\ref{fig:l2}). 

\label{sub:Wasserstein distance}
\begin{minipage}{.45\textwidth}
\begin{equation}
    W_{p}(\mu,\nu):=\left(\inf_{\gamma\in\Phi(\mu,\nu)}\int_{\chi}d(x,y)^{p}\,\mathrm{d}\gamma(x,y)\right)^{1/p} \label{eq:w-dist-def}
\end{equation}
\end{minipage}

\end{minipage}

Wasserstein distance can overcome these difficulties. Wasserstein distance between distribution $\mu$ and $\nu$ can be regarded as the minimal effort to transport mass from the distribution $\mu$ to $\nu$, which is often described as earth move distance. Further the mass moves, the more the effort we need to give. The transport plan between 2 different one-dimensional random variable distribution is described by $\gamma(x, y)$, which is a two-dimensional random variable distribution. $d(x,y)^{p}$ in the formula~\eqref{eq:w-dist-def} is the Borel measure on Polish spaces \cite{villani_2009}. There is a minimum function in the functional space of $\gamma(x, y)$, whose corresponding $W_{p}(\mu,\nu)$ is the Wasserstein distance between $\mu$ and $\nu$. 

The calculation of Wasserstein distance, however, is not always easy and may suffer from the deficiency of analytical expression, especially when we deriving the loss function in the method of CNN. In practice, we set $p=1$. As the hittime in our waveform analysis results is discrete values (time bin edges in a DAQ window), the loss, Wasserstein distance (abbreviated as W-dist) between $\hat{q}$ and $q$ can be calculated numerically. The corresponding charge $q$ of PE is each hittime can be regarded as weight in the distribution of hittime. Suppose $A$ and $B$ represent two sets of PE's hittime and charge. First, the hittime $t$ are rounded to the nearest integer in the DAQ window. Then we subtract the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of A, $F_{A}$, and the CDF of B, $F_{B}$. Finally, we sum the absolute value of the subtraction, which is formula \eqref{eq:numerical}. The whole process is equivalent to calculating the L1 distance of cumulative distribution function of distribution $A$ and $B$. It is proved that the distance we define here is equivalent to Wasserstein distance with minor loss of accuracy (caused by rounding). 

\begin{equation}
    D_w = \sum_t|F_{A}(t) - F_{B}(t)|
    \label{eq:numerical}
\end{equation}

Wasserstein distance is more sensitive to the distribution of PEs, together with
