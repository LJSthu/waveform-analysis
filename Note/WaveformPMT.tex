\section{Waveform of PMT} % (fold)
PMT is a device which is highly sensitive to even single photon. Therefore, PMT is widely used in neutrino experiments based on liquid and dark matter experiment. In neutrino experiments, liquid scintillator emits light after excited by candidate particles and charged particles emit Cherenkov light in liquid. Timing resolution is crucial in neutrino event reconstruction. 

Timing resolution is determined by PMT and waveform analysis. Typical PMT response includes 3 individual processes: PE conversion happened on photocathode. Electron collection by the first dynode. And amplification of electrons between dynodes. So 1 photon incoming has a certain probability to be observed via PMT voltage (See figure~\ref{fig:spe}). But if photons hit the PMT continually, the PE response will pile-up (see figure~\ref{fig:pile}) and the waveform analysis will be difficult. Pile-up will significantly worsen timing resolution.

Naively, when handling PMT waveform we record the first $t_{H}$ according to $v_{th}$ and $Q$. One waveform is converted to a pair of numbers. More detailed information of the waveform (see figure~\ref{fig:tradi}) was lost. The new goal in this work is to extract information of all hits in 1 DAQ window including $t_{H}$ \& $q_{r}(t_{H})$ or $n_{r}(t_{H})$ (see figure~\ref{fig:new}).

Charge is the integration of waveform component which induced by SPE. SPE induced charge can be a wide distribution, rather than a single value. Reconstructing $n_{r}(t_{H})$ is more difficult than reconstructing $q_{r}(t_{H})$.
