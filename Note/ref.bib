The circuit integrates always its input taking advantage of the AC coupling to the photomultipliers that equalizes to zero the charge associated with each event signal. A double sampling of the integrator output allows to perform a charge measurement in principle without dead time, avoiding the use of gate signals and baseline restoration networks and permitting a precise detection of the fast correlated events (delayed coincidences due to the decay of a nuclide producing a daughter having a lifetime in the tens of ns time range). The precision of the charge measurement is discussed together with the performances of the front end Borexino board where the integrator is mounted.},

For liquid scintillator calorimetry, the most critical requirement to waveform reconstruction is linearity. Several common reconstruction methods were tested but the linearity performance was not satisfactory. A new method based on the deconvolution technique was developed with 1\% residual non-linearity, which fulfills the requirement. The performance was validated with both data and Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, and 1\% consistency between them has been achieved.},

Though originating in physics, Hamiltonian dynamics can be applied to most problems with continuous state spaces by simply introducing fictitious "momentum" variables. A key to its usefulness is that Hamiltonian dynamics preserves volume, and its trajectories can thus be used to define complex mappings without the need to account for a hard-to-compute Jacobian factor - a property that can be exactly maintained even when the dynamics is approximated by discretizing time. In this review, I discuss theoretical and practical aspects of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, and present some of its variations, including using windows of states for deciding on acceptance or rejection, computing trajectories using fast approximations, tempering during the course of a trajectory to handle isolated modes, and short-cut methods that prevent useless trajectories from taking much computation time.},

It is also capable of observing neutrinos from terrestrial and extra-terrestrial sources, including supernova burst neutrinos, diffuse supernova neutrino background, geoneutrinos, atmospheric neutrinos, solar neutrinos, as well as exotic searches such as nucleon decays, dark matter, sterile neutrinos, etc. We present the physics motivations and the anticipated performance of the JUNO detector for various proposed measurements. By detecting reactor antineutrinos from two power plants at 53-km distance, JUNO will determine the neutrino mass hierarchy at a 3-4 sigma significance with six years of running. The measurement of antineutrino spectrum will also lead to the precise determination of three out of the six oscillation parameters to an accuracy of better than 1{\textbackslash}\%. Neutrino burst from a typical core-collapse supernova at 10 kpc would lead to {\textasciitilde}5000 inverse-beta-decay events and {\textasciitilde}2000 all-flavor neutrino-proton elastic scattering events in JUNO. Detection of DSNB would provide valuable information on the cosmic star-formation rate and the average core-collapsed neutrino energy spectrum. Geo-neutrinos can be detected in JUNO with a rate of {\textasciitilde}400 events per year, significantly improving the statistics of existing geoneutrino samples. The JUNO detector is sensitive to several exotic searches, e.g. proton decay via the \$p{\textbackslash}to K{\textasciicircum}++{\textbackslash}bar{\textbackslash}nu\$ decay channel. The JUNO detector will provide a unique facility to address many outstanding crucial questions in particle and astrophysics. It holds the great potential for further advancing our quest to understanding the fundamental properties of neutrinos, one of the building blocks of our Universe.},

	abstract = {JUNO is a multi-purpose neutrino experiment currently under construction in Jiangmen, China. It is primarily aiming to determine the neutrino mass ordering. Moreover, its 20 kt target mass makes it an ideal detector to study neutrinos from various sources, including nuclear reactors, the Earth and its atmosphere, the Sun, and even supernovae. Due to the small cross section of neutrino interactions, the event rate of neutrino experiments is limited. In order to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio, it is extremely important to control the background levels. In this paper we discuss the potential of particle identification in JUNO, its underlying principles and possible areas of application in the experiment. While the presented concepts can be transferred to any large liquid scintillator detector, our methods are evaluated specifically for JUNO and the results are mainly driven by its high optical photon yield of 1,200 photo electrons per MeV of deposited energy. In order to investigate the potential of event discrimination, several event pairings are analysed, i.e. α/β, p/β, e+/e−, and e−/γ. We compare the discrimination performance of advanced analytical techniques based on neural networks and on the topological event reconstruction keeping the standard Gatti filter as a reference. We use the Monte Carlo samples generated in the physically motivated energy intervals. We study the dependence of our cuts on energy, radial position, PMT time resolution, and dark noise. The results show an excellent performance for α/β and p/β with the Gatti method and the neural network. Furthermore, e+/e− and e−/γ can partly be distinguished by means of neural network and topological reconstruction on a statistical basis. Especially in the latter case, the topological method proved very successful.},

Furthermore, our algorithm can effectively depress the ringings that are often shown in the 1D resulting spectra of other deconvolution methods.},

	abstract = {Deeper neural networks are more difficult to train. We present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers---8x deeper than VGG nets but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57\% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28\% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to ILSVRC \& COCO 2015 competitions, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation.},

	abstract = {The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks in an encoder-decoder configuration. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},

	abstract = {Blind source separation is aimed at recovering original independent signals when their linear mixtures are observed. Various methods for estimating a recovering matrix have been proposed and applied to data in many fields, such as biological signal processing, communication engineering, and financial market data analysis. One problem these methods have is that they are often too sensitive to outliers, and the existence of a few outliers might change the estimate drastically. In this article, we propose a robust method of blind source separation based on the beta divergence. Shift parameters are explicitly included in our model instead of the conventional way which assumes that original signals have zero mean. The estimator gives smaller weights to possible outliers so that their influence on the estimate is weakened. Simulation results show that the proposed estimator significantly improves the performance over the existing methods when outliers exist; it keeps equal performance otherwise.},

We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of both distances, and statistical issues involved in computing them from data. We also report some texture classification results for the Mallows distance applied to texture features and compare several ways of estimating feature distributions. In addition, we list some known probabilistic properties of this distance.},

Six 2.9-{GW}\$\_\{{\textbackslash}rm th\}\$ nuclear power reactors of the Daya Bay and Ling Ao nuclear power facilities served as intense sources of \${\textbackslash}overline\{{\textbackslash}nu\}\_\{e\}\$'s. Comparison of the \${\textbackslash}overline\{{\textbackslash}nu\}\_\{e\}\$ rate and energy spectrum measured by antineutrino detectors far from the nuclear reactors (\${\textbackslash}sim\$1500-1950 m) relative to detectors near the reactors (\${\textbackslash}sim\$350-600 m) allowed a precise measurement of \${\textbackslash}overline\{{\textbackslash}nu\}\_\{e\}\$ disappearance. More than 2.5 million \${\textbackslash}overline\{{\textbackslash}nu\}\_\{e\}\$ inverse beta decay interactions were observed, based on the combination of 217 days of operation of six antineutrino detectors (Dec. 2011--Jul. 2012) with a subsequent 1013 days using the complete configuration of eight detectors (Oct. 2012--Jul. 2015). The \${\textbackslash}overline\{{\textbackslash}nu\}\_\{e\}\$ rate observed at the far detectors relative to the near detectors showed a significant deficit, \$R=0.949 {\textbackslash}pm 0.002({\textbackslash}mathrm\{stat.\}) {\textbackslash}pm 0.002({\textbackslash}mathrm\{syst.\})\$. The energy dependence of \${\textbackslash}overline\{{\textbackslash}nu\}\_\{e\}\$ disappearance showed the distinct variation predicted by neutrino oscillation.

It is shown that as little as 20–25 percent of the Fourier spectrum is sufficient in practice for a high‐quality reconstruction. The method employs linear programming to minimize the L1‐norm of the output, because minimization of this norm favors solutions with isolated spikes. Given a wavelet, this technique can be used to perform deconvolution of noisy seismograms when the desired output is a sparse spike series. Relative reliability of the data is assessed in the frequency domain, and only the reliable spectral data are included in the calculation of the spike series. Equations for the unknown spike amplitudes are solved to an accuracy compatible with the uncertainties in the reliable data. In examples with 10 percent random noise, the output is superior to that obtained using conventional least‐squares techniques.},
