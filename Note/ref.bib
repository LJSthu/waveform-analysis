	abstract = {A gateless charge integrator designed for the energy measurement in the Borexino experiment is described and the results of various tests performed on prototypes are shown. The circuit integrates always its input taking advantage of the AC coupling to the photomultipliers that equalizes to zero the charge associated with each event signal. A double sampling of the integrator output allows to perform a charge measurement in principle without dead time, avoiding the use of gate signals and baseline restoration networks and permitting a precise detection of the fast correlated events (delayed coincidences due to the decay of a nuclide producing a daughter having a lifetime in the tens of ns time range). The precision of the charge measurement is discussed together with the performances of the front end Borexino board where the integrator is mounted.},

This paper presents the design, data acquisition, and simulation of the Flash ADC system, and focuses on the PMT waveform reconstruction algorithms. For liquid scintillator calorimetry, the most critical requirement to waveform reconstruction is linearity. Several common reconstruction methods were tested but the linearity performance was not satisfactory. A new method based on the deconvolution technique was developed with 1\% residual non-linearity, which fulfills the requirement. The performance was validated with both data and Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, and 1\% consistency between them has been achieved.},

	abstract = {Radioactive isotopes produced through cosmic muon spallation are a background for rare-event detection in \${\textbackslash}nu\$ detectors, double-\${\textbackslash}beta\$-decay experiments, and dark-matter searches. Understanding the nature of cosmogenic backgrounds is particularly important for future experiments aiming to determine the pep and CNO solar neutrino fluxes, for which the background is dominated by the spallation production of \${\textasciicircum}\{11\}\$C. Data from the Kamioka liquid-scintillator antineutrino detector (KamLAND) provides valuable information for better understanding these backgrounds, especially in liquid scintillators, and for checking estimates from current simulations based upon MUSIC, FLUKA, and GEANT4. Using the time correlation between detected muons and neutron captures, the neutron production yield in the KamLAND liquid scintillator is measured to be \$(2.8 {\textbackslash}pm 0.3) {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{-4\} {\textbackslash}mu{\textasciicircum}\{-1\} g{\textasciicircum}\{-1\} cm{\textasciicircum}\{2\}\$. For other isotopes, the production yield is determined from the observed time correlation related to known isotope lifetimes. We find some yields are inconsistent with extrapolations based on an accelerator muon beam experiment.},

	abstract = {JUNO is proposed to determine the neutrino mass hierarchy and rich in many other neutrino topics. A prototype is designed and set up for better understanding sub-systems of future detector. The preliminary results show that its threshold reaches {\textasciitilde}0.3MeV with trigger rate {\textasciitilde}290 Hz on the ground with cosmic muon rate {\textasciitilde}35 Hz. Aiming for a better detector understanding from PMT signal, three reconstruction algorithms are compared for PMT waveforms with different overshoot ratios, including charge integration, waveform fitting, and deconvolution. It is concluded that the three methods have similar performance on uncertainty and systematic bias while deconvolution algorithm is best to handle larger overshoot and the simplest charge integration could be considered with controlled overshoot for future fast preliminary reconstruction.},
