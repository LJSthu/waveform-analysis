Traditionally, we only save charge integration and time over threshold of the waveform output of PMT in neutrino experiments. But extracting the information of time and number of photons hitting will provide more detailed information of light transmit model in detector and will finally enhance the performance of event reconstruction, even particle identification. Therefore PMT waveform analysis is necessary when we pursue completely usage of PMT output.
