\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We develop and compare a collection of waveform analysis methods.  FSMP gives the best accuracy in both time and intensity, while CNN, Fitting and LucyDDM follow closely.  We find significant time~($\times 2$) and intensity~(\SIrange{20}{40}{\percent}) resolution improvements at higher and lower light intensities respectively.  It opens the oppotunity to boost energy resolution and particle identification in PMT-based neutrino and dark matter experiments.
