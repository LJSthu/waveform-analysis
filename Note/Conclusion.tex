\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

This study develops and compares a collection of waveform analysis methods. The employ of Wasserstein distance and RSS as the figure of merit enables us to train algorithms that are sensitive to time and charge. The algorithm FBMP gives the best all-around performance, while CNN, Gradient Descent, and LucyDDM follow closely. These methods show evident improvements in time and charge resolution. They will improve event reconstruction and particle identification in neutrino experiments and dark matter experiments based on PMTs.
