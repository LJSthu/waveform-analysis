\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We develop and compare a collection of waveform analysis methods. The employ of Wasserstein distance and RSS as the figure of merit enables us to train algorithms that are sensitive to time and charge. The algorithm FSMP gives the best all-around performance, while CNN, Gradient Descent, and LucyDDM follow closely. These methods improvements in time and charge resolution, consequently improve event reconstruction and particle identification in PMT-based neutrino and dark matter experiments.
