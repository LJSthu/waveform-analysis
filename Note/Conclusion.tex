In this study, a collection of waveform analysis methods is developed and compared. The employ of Wasserstein distance as the figure of merit enables us to train algorithms that are sensitive to timing and charge. The algorithm FBMP performs the best comprehensive performance within all methods when reconstructing charge information, while CNN, Gradient Descent, and LucyDDM following closely. FBMP achieves a balance between precision and efficiency among CPU computing methods. These methods show evident improvements in timing resolution. They will improve event reconstruction and particle identification in neutrino experiments and dark matter experiments based on PMTs.
