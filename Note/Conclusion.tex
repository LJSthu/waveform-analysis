\label{sec:conclusion}

In this study a collection of waveform analysis methods is developed and compared. The employ of Wasserstein distance as the figure of merit enables us to train algorithms which are sensitive to timing. The algorithm containing a CNN network performs the best within all methods when reconstructing charge information, while Fitting, LucyDDM amd HMC following closely. LucyDDM achieves balance between precision and efficiency among CPU computing methods. These methods shows evident improvements of timeing resolution. They will improve event reconstruction and particle identification in neutrino experiments and dark matter experiments based on PMTs.
