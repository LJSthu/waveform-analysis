\section{Conclusion and Discussion} % (fold)
In this paper a collection of waveform analysis methods is developed and compared. The employ of Wasserstein distance as the figure of merit enables us to train algorithms which are sensitive to timing. The algorithm containing a CNN network whose W-dist is $0.246^{+0.175}_{-0.198}\mathrm{ns}$ ($0.760^{+1.020}_{-0.746}\mathrm{ns}$) performs the best within all methods when reconstructing charge (\#PE) information, while fitting method resulted in W-dist of $0.504^{+0.366}_{-0.344}\mathrm{ns}$ ($2.460^{+2.37}_{-1.89}\mathrm{ns}$) on our dataset. Lucy deconvolution achieves balance between precision and efficiency among CPU computing methods. These results will improve event reconstruction and particle identification in neutrino experiments and dark matter experiments based on PMTs.
