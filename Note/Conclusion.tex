\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

This study develops and compares a collection of waveform analysis methods. The employ of Wasserstein distance and RSS as the figure of merit enables us to train algorithms that are sensitive to timing and charge. The algorithm FBMP gives the best all-around performance when all the methods reconstruct charge information, while CNN, Gradient Descent, and LucyDDM follow closely. FBMP achieves a balance between precision and efficiency among CPU computing methods. These methods show evident improvements in timing and charge resolution. They will improve event reconstruction and particle identification in neutrino experiments and dark matter experiments based on PMTs.
