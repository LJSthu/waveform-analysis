\subsection{Physical processes and PMT}

Typical PMT response includes 3 individual processes: PE conversion happened on photocathode. Electron collection by the first dynode. And amplification of electrons between dynodes. So 1 photon incoming has a certain probability to be observed via PMT voltage (See figure~\ref{fig:spe}). But if photons hit the PMT continually, the PE response will pile-up (see figure~\ref{fig:pile}) and the waveform analysis will be difficult. Pile-up will significantly worsen timing resolution.

Most of the time, when handling PMT waveform we record the first $t$ of PE arrival according to threshold of voltage, $v_{th}$, and total Charge in a DAQ window, $Q$. One waveform is converted to a pair of numbers. More detailed information of the waveform was lost. The intention this work is extracting information of all hits in 1 DAQ window including $t$ \& reconstructed charge, $q_{r}(t)$. 

Charge is the integration of waveform component which induced by SPE. SPE induced charge can be a wide distribution, rather than a single value.

The Time of waveform, $t$, we defined here is discrete value in 1 DAQ window (from 0 to 1029ns, step size is 1ns in Jinping 1ton prototype DAQ system). Therefore total number of hittime in a DAQ window, $N_{pos}$, is not equal to $N_{pe}$ ($N_{pe} \geq N_{pos}$). 

\subsection{toy Monte Carlo}

In toy MC, we describe the light transmit process using a hypothetical parameterized time profile model. We assume the time profile of the liquid scintillator is an exponential function convoluted by a gaussian function\cite{li_separation_2016} caused by the transit time spread of PMT, with the form in the formula \eqref{eq:time-pro}. 

\begin{equation}
    f(t) = \frac{1}{\tau}e^{-\frac{t - t_{0}}{\tau}} \otimes \mathcal{N}(\sigma)
    \label{eq:time-pro}
\end{equation}

The total number of PE in a DAQ window (in a single waveform), $N_{pe}$, is sampled from a Poisson distribution with expectation $\mu$. Then the charge and hittime is sampled from the time profile of the liquid scintillator. We used Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) to estimate $t_{0}$ in formula\eqref{eq:time-pro}, which is the rise time of the time profile. The typical combination of decay time ($\tau$) and transit time spread ($\sigma$) are listed in figure (see figure~\ref{fig:reso-diff}). For every PE expectation $\mu$, a sample set (size $N=10,000$) is generated to estimate the time resolution $\delta$, which is the residual ($\Delta t_{0}$) distribution spread. 

The result of the toy MC shows in figure~\ref{fig:reso-diff}, where $\delta_{1st}$ and $\delta_{all}$ are time resolution when using the first PE and all PE, respectively. Error bars are too thin to be seen. It is distinct that the time resolution is smaller when reconstructing rise time using all PE.

Before taking deep look into the methods, input and output need to be defined. A Geant4\cite{agostinelli_geant4simulation_2003}-based simulation package simulated events in the 1-ton detector\cite{wang_design_2017}. After collected, all data but PMT response is discarded. The input for waveform analysis is pedestal subtracted PMT waveform (see figure~\ref{fig:input}), and the output is the $q_{r}$ or $n_{r}$ sequence (see figure~\ref{fig:output}).
