\subsection{Light Curve}
In the PMT-based experiments, a particle interact with and deposit energy into the detector along its trajectory. Part of the deposited energy becomes visible as Cherenkov or scintillation photons.  The timing distribution of the emitted photons is called the \textit{light curve}.  A scintillation light curve of is modeled as a mixture of several exponential components with different decay rates~\cite{ludhova_particle_2020}.  Cherenkov light curve is essentially instantaneous, modeled by a Dirac $\delta(t)$ function.

Photons captured by a PMT are affected by transit time spread (TTS).  In our Monte Carlo setup, the effective light curve $\Phi(t)$ at PMT is modeled as an exponential distribution convoluted with a gaussian~\cite{li_separation_2016}, known as \textit{ex-Gaussian} or \textit{exponentially modified gaussian},
\begin{align}
    \Phi(t) = \frac{1}{2\tau} \exp\left(\frac{\sigma^2}{2\tau^2}-\frac{t-t_0}{\tau}\right) \left[1 - \erf\left( \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{2}\tau} - \frac{t-t_0}{\sqrt{2}\sigma} \right)\right]
    \label{eq:time-pro}
\end{align}
where $t_0$ is when the exponential starts and $\tau$ is its decay life time.  $\sigma$ encodes the timing uncertainty mainly from TTS.  $\Phi(t)$ of Cherenkov light is a pure gaussian without the exponential.  Figure~\ref{fig:time-pro} gives several examples of $\Phi(t)$.

\subsection{Single PE Response}

Typical PMT response includes several individual processes. First, single photon hits on the surface of PMT, and transmission happens in the glass window and photoelectron (PE) conversion happens on the photocathode. Then PE is collected by the first dynode. Finally, the amplification of electrons between dynodes provides a measurable electrical signal. A single incoming photon has a certain probability to be observed via PMT voltage (see figure~\ref{fig:spe}), obeying Bernoulli distribution. Several PEs could pile up in the DAQ time window, as illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:pile}.  Failing to separate them can worse the timing resolution.

  \caption{A single PE induces a voltage pulse as in \subref{fig:spe}.  They pile up after arriving at one PMT, manifested in the waveform in \subref{fig:pile}.}
\end{figure}

The data acquisition system digitizes a time series of voltages output from a PMT. We usually record the time of the first PE according to the threshold of voltage, $V_\mathrm{th}$, and total charge in a DAQ window. The voltage which is higher than a certain threshold is assumed to be the consequence of photoelectron. The total charge is the integration of the waveform. Charge induced single photoelectron (SPE) can be a wide distribution (usually truncated normal distribution, mean is $\mu_{g}$, the standard deviation is $\sigma_{g}$) rather than a single value (see the black curve in figure~\ref{fig:recchargehist}). In these practical scenarios, one waveform is converted to a pair of numbers. More detailed information on the waveform was lost. 


The total number of PEs in a single waveform, $N_\mathrm{PE}$, is sampled from a zero-trucated Poisson distribution with expectation $\mu$. The hittime $t$ of each PE is sampled from the light curve $P_{t}(t)$. The charge of each PE $q$ is sampled from a truncated normal distribution in \eqref{eq:truncated}. The simulation datasets are the combination of $t$ and $q$.

\begin{equation}
    P_{q}(q) = A\cdot\mathcal{N}(\mu_{q},\sigma_{q}^{2}),\,(q>0)
    \label{eq:truncated}
\end{equation}

The single photonelectron response is described as the formula \eqref{eq:dayaspe} \cite{jetter_pmt_2012}. An gaussian noise is added to waveform after sampling $t$ and $q$. 

\begin{equation}
    V_\mathrm{PE}(t) = V_{0}\exp\left[-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\ln(t/\tau)}{\sigma}\right)^{2}\right]
    \label{eq:dayaspe}
\end{equation}

The typical combination of decay time ($\tau$) and transit time spread ($\sigma$) are listed in Fig.~\ref{fig:reso-diff}. We take the value of $\tau$ according to typical liquid scintillator used in JUNO \cite{ludhova_particle_2020}. For every combination of PE number expectation $\mu$, decay time $\tau$ and TTS $\sigma$, a sample set (size $N=10,000$) is generated to estimate the timing resolution $\delta$. 

\subsection{Timing Measurement}
The estimation result of $t_{0}$ using simulated data is shown in figure~\ref{fig:reso-diff}, where $\delta_{\mathrm{1st}}$ and $\delta_{\mathrm{all}}$ are timing resolution using the first PE and all PE when reconstruction, respectively. The vertical axis is the ratio, $\delta_{\mathrm{all}}/\delta_{\mathrm{1st}}$. Because time resolution estimation here is only based on simulated data, the result will reveal the advantage of using detailed information of all PE. It is distinct that the timing resolution is smaller when reconstructing rise time using all PE.

\end{figure}

We can use Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) to estimate $t_{0}$ in formula \eqref{eq:time-pro}, which is the starting time of light curve, using charge $q$ and corresponding hittime. The difference between real starting time $t_{0tru}$ and reconstructed starting time $\hat{t}_0$ are collected to produce the starting time residual ($\Delta t_{0}=\hat{t}_0-t_0$) distribution. The time resolution $\delta$ is the standard deviation, $s$, of the starting time residual distribution, which is formula \eqref{eq:resolution}. The likelihood $\mathcal{L}$ defined in MLE is formula \eqref{eq:likelihood}. 

\begin{align}
  \delta &= s_{\Delta t_{0}} = s_{\hat{t}_0-t_0} \label{eq:resolution} \\
  \mathcal{L}(t_{0}) &= e^{-\mu}\Pi_{i=0}^{N}P_{t}(t_{i})^{q_{i}} \label{eq:likelihood}
\end{align}


Before taking a deep look into the methods, input and output need to be defined. The input for waveform analysis is pedestal subtracted PMT waveform (see figure~\ref{fig:input}), and the output is the $q_{rec}$ sequence (see figure~\ref{fig:output}), which is interpreted as an approximation of light curve.
