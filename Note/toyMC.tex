In this section, we discuss why waveform analysis is crucial for timing measurements in PMT-based experiments. 

\subsection{Light Curve}
In the PMT-based experiments, a particle interact with and deposit energy into the detector along its trajectory. Part of the deposited energy becomes visible as Cherenkov or scintillation photons.  The timing distribution of the emitted photons is called the \textit{light curve}.  A scintillation light curve of is modeled as a mixture of several exponential components with different decay rates~\cite{ludhova_particle_2020}.  Cherenkov light curve is essentially instantaneous, modeled by a Dirac $\delta(t)$ function.

Photons captured by a PMT are affected by transit time spread (TTS).  In our Monte Carlo setup, the effective light curve $\Phi(t)$ at PMT is modeled as an exponential distribution convoluted with a Gaussian~\cite{li_separation_2016}, known as \textit{ex-Gaussian} or \textit{exponentially modified Gaussian},
\begin{align}
    \Phi(t) = \frac{1}{2\tau} \exp\left(\frac{\sigma^2}{2\tau^2}-\frac{t-t_0}{\tau}\right) \left[1 - \erf\left( \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{2}\tau} - \frac{t-t_0}{\sqrt{2}\sigma} \right)\right]
    \label{eq:time-pro}
\end{align}
where $t_0$ is when the exponential starts and $\tau$ is the decay life time.  $\sigma$ encodes the timing uncertainty mainly from TTS.  $\Phi(t)$ of Cherenkov light is a pure Gaussian without the exponential, or equivalently taking the limit $\tau \rightarrow 0$.  Figure~\ref{fig:time-pro} gives several examples of $\Phi(t)$.

\subsection{Single PE Response}
A photon can produce a PE at the PMT photocathode.  The PE is then accelerated, collected and amplified into $\num[retain-unity-mantissa=false]{\sim 1e7}$ electrons.  The electrons forms a voltage pulse $V_\mathrm{PE}(t)$ in the PMT output and is acquired by the digitizers as a time series called a \textit{waveform} $w(t)$~(Fig.~\ref{fig:spe}).

  \end{subfigure}
  \caption{A single PE induces a voltage pulse as in \subref{fig:spe}.  They pile up after arriving at one PMT, manifested in the waveform in \subref{fig:pile}.}
\end{figure}

We use the parameterization of Daya Bay~\cite{jetter_pmt_2012} for the single PE response pulse,
\begin{equation}
  V_\mathrm{PE}(t) = V_{0}\exp\left[-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\log(t/\tau_\mathrm{PE})}{\sigma_\mathrm{PE}}\right)^{2}\right]
  \label{eq:dayaspe}
\end{equation}
where $\tau_\mathrm{PE}=\SI{8}{ns}$, $\sigma_\mathrm{PE}=\SI{0.5}{ns}$ are shape parameters and $V_{0}=\SI{14.08}{mV}$, see Fig.~\ref{fig:spe}.  There can be several PEs piling up in a waveform.  We model the waveform as
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:1}
  w(t) = \sum_{i=1}^{N_\mathrm{PE}} q_i V_\mathrm{PE}(t-t_i) + \epsilon(t)
\end{equation}
where $N_\mathrm{PE}$ is the number of PEs obeying Poisson distribution with expectation $\mu$, $t_i$ is the hittime of the $i$-th PE sampled from the light curve $\Phi(t)$ in \eqref{eq:time-pro} and Fig.~\ref{fig:time-pro}, $q_i$ is the relative charge of the $i$-th PE from a Gaussian $\mathcal{N}(1,\sigma_{q}^2)$, and $\epsilon(t)$ is a Gaussian white noise.  A waveform example is illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:pile}.

\subsection{Timing Measurement}
Obviously in Fig.~\ref{fig:pile}, pile-ups and noises hinder resolution of PEs from a waveform.  A widely used compromise is to extract the waveform rising edge $T_1$ over a voltage threshold $V_\mathrm{th}$ and a total charge $Q$ by integration, reducing $w(t)$ into a pair of numbers $(T_1, Q)$.

Timing measurement of $t_0$ in \eqref{eq:time-pro} is the key to vertex reconstruction and particle identification.  For $T_1$-$Q$ reduction, $t_0$ is estimated by $\hat{t}_\mathrm{1st} = T_1$. $\hat{t}_\mathrm{1st}$ is biased and subject to corrections based on $N_\mathrm{PE}$ expectation $\mu$.  $\sigma_\mathrm{1st}$, the standard deviation of $\hat{t}_\mathrm{1st} - t_0$, reflects the timing resolution of $T_1$-$Q$ reduction when the knowledge of $\mu$ is exact.

A perfect measurement of $t_i$ gives an ideal maximum likelihood estimator $\hat{t}_\mathrm{ALL}$ using all the PEs,
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:2}
  \hat{t}_\mathrm{ALL} = \underset{t_0}{\arg \max} \prod_{i=1}^{N_\mathrm{PE}} \Phi(t-t_0-t_i).
\end{equation}
The corresponding $\sigma_\mathrm{ALL}$ is the lower limit of any timing measurement.  Situations when $\sigma_\mathrm{1st} > \sigma_\mathrm{ALL}$ necessitate more sophisticated waveform analysis methods.

Combinations of $\tau$ and $\sigma$ in the light curve~\eqref{eq:time-pro} are investigated under a scan of $\mu$ \numrange{0}{30}. For scintillation paired with ultra-fast PMTs, $\tau \gg \sigma$.  $\tau \ll \sigma$ is the Cherenkov case.  The $\tau=20, \sigma=5$ case represents a standard scintillation experiment like JUNO~\cite{ludhova_particle_2020}.  For every triple of $(\tau, \sigma, \mu)$, a sample of $10,000$ waveforms is generated for timing resolution estimation.

Figure~\ref{fig:reso-diff} shows that $\sigma_{\mathrm{1st}}=\sigma_{\mathrm{ALL}}$ when $\mu \to 0$ or $\tau \gg \sigma$, which explains the widespread utilization of the $T_1$-$Q$ reduction.  When $\mu \to 0$ there is at most 1 PE in a waveform.  When $\tau \gg \sigma$, the light curve $\Phi(t)$ is an exponential whose $\hat{t}_\mathrm{ALL}$ in \eqref{eq:2} is exactly $\hat{t}_\mathrm{1st}$.  Nevertheless, even when $\mu = 1$, $\sigma_{\mathrm{1st}} - \sigma_{\mathrm{ALL}}$ is noticeable for $\sigma > 0$ cases, covering standard Cherenkov and scintillation experiments with non-negligible PMT TTS.

  \caption{\label{fig:reso-diff} Timing resolution comparison between $\hat{t}_{\mathrm{ALL}}$~(solid lines) when using full PE information and $\hat{t}_\mathrm{1st}$~(dasshed lines) when only the first PE is used.  The difference is manifested especially when $\sigma$ and $\mu$ is large.  3 cases of $(\tau, \sigma)/\si{ns}$ represent scintillation with ultra-fast PMTs~$(20,0)$, Cherenkov~$(0, 5)$ and scintilation~$(20, 5)$ coupled with PMT TTS. Performance of waveform analysis lies between these two extremes.}
\end{figure}

In waveform analysis, we design estimators of $\hat{N}_\mathrm{PE}$, $\hat{t}_i$ and $\hat{q}_i$ to be deployed into \eqref{eq:2} with the aim of recovering $\hat{t}_\mathrm{ALL}$ to the best possible extent.
