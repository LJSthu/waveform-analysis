In April 2018, the Jinping Neutrino Experiment group proposed a \href{https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzA4MTAwMzgzOA==&mid=2650872289&idx=2&sn=48145a6598545d201f940e0459de99dd&chksm=846e2db0b319a4a627e902d0d6ed4b9d968225566021342c5935764963f352fbe02db1bdb333&mpshare=1&scene=1&srcid=0307c4HOvK0ChJUcq9blC3ub%23rd}{online data contest} whose topic is PMT waveform analysis. During the contest, Wasserstein distance is used to assess the performance of algorithms. After the contest, we collected several algorithms submitted by participants and we checked, redesigned, and tested these algorithms to develop practical data processing flow applied on neutrino experiments where PMT is included.
