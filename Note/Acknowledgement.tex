In April 2019, we proposed a \href{https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzA4MTAwMzgzOA==&mid=2650872289&idx=2&sn=48145a6598545d201f940e0459de99dd&chksm=846e2db0b319a4a627e902d0d6ed4b9d968225566021342c5935764963f352fbe02db1bdb333&mpshare=1&scene=1&srcid=0307c4HOvK0ChJUcq9blC3ub%23rd}{online data contest} whose topic is PMT waveform analysis. During the contest, Wasserstein distance was used to assess the performance of algorithms. After the contest, we collected several algorithms submitted by participants and we checked, redesigned, and tested these algorithms to develop practical data processing flow applied on neutrino experiments where PMT is included. This work is supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (11620101004), the Key Laboratory of Particle \& Radiation Imaging (Tsinghua University).
