\section{Wasserstein distance} % (fold)
A figure of merit to distinguish the difference between reconstruction result and the truth is crucial. $P(X)$ and $Q(X)$ are 2 probability density function of random variable $X$. There are many ways to measure the difference (distance) of $P(X)$ and $Q(X)$: 

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{minipage}{.25\textwidth}
\begin{align*}
    L_{1} &= \int|p-q| \ud t \\
    L_{2} &= \int(p-q)^{2} \ud t \\
    \chi^{2} &= \int\frac{(p-q)^{2}}{q} \ud t \\
    \cdots
\end{align*}
\end{minipage}

\end{minipage}
\end{figure}

But these distances have certain shortcomings. They cannot compare discrete distribution with continuous distribution. And they are not sensitive to timing: as the graph shows, the L2 distances between the distribution of $a,b_{1}$ and $a,b_{2}$ is both 0.25, but the shape of the $b_{1}$ and $b_{2}$ distribution is very different (see figure~\ref{fig:l2}). 

\label{sub:Wasserstein distance}
    \begin{equation}
        W_{p}(\mu,\nu):=\left(\inf_{\gamma\in\Phi(\mu,\nu)}\int_{\chi}d(x,y)^{p}\,\mathrm{d}\gamma(x,y)\right)^{1/p} \label{eq:w-dist-def}
    \end{equation}

Wasserstein distance can overcome these difficulty. Wasserstein distance between $\mu$ and $\nu$ as the minimal effort to transport mass from distribution $\mu$ to $\nu$. Further the mass moves, more the effort we need to give. The transport plan is described by $\gamma(x, y)$. $d(x,y)^{p}$ in the formula~\eqref{eq:w-dist-def} is the Borel measure on Polish spaces\cite{villani_2009}. There is a minimum function in the functional space of $\gamma(x, y)$, whose corresponding $W_{p}(\mu ,\nu)$ is the Wasserstein distance between $\mu$ and $\nu$. 

In practice, the loss (Wasserstein distance, abbreviated as W-dist) we used in numerical calculation is defined here. We first calculate subtraction of the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of A and the CDF of B. Then take the sum (or integral) of absolute value of the subtraction. That is the L1 distance of cumulative distribution function of A \& B. It is proved that the distance we define here is equivalent to Wasserstein distance. 

\begin{equation}
    W_{p}=\sum_t|\mathrm{CDF}_A(t) - \mathrm{CDF}_B(t)|
\end{equation}
