Photomultiplier tube~(PMT) voltage waveforms are the raw data of many neutrino and dark matter experiments. Waveform analysis is the first critical step of data processing. We evaluate several methods of waveform analysis, among whichfast stochastic matching pursuits is the best, direct demodulation and convolutional neural networks also promising.  Our results show that significant time~(up to $\time 2$) and energy~(up to \SIrange{20}{40}{\percent}) resolution boosts are attainable.  This forms the data analysis cornerstones of all PMT-based neutrino and dark matter experiments.
