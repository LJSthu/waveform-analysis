Photomultiplier tube~(PMT) voltage waveforms are the raw data of many neutrino and dark matter search experiments.  Waveform analysis is usually the first and critical step of data processing.  Targeting precise timing extraction, we develop and evaluate several waveform analysis methods, among which direct demodulation, convolutional neural network~(CNN), and Bayesian matching pursuit are the best.  Timing resolution is improved upon the traditional thresholding method found in timing digital circuits, most significantly with high energy events when photoelectrons pile up in waveforms.
