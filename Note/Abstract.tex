Photomultiplier tube~(PMT) voltage waveforms are the raw data of many neutrino and dark matter search experiments.  Waveform analysis is usually the first and critical step of data processing.  Targeting precise timing extraction, we develop and evaluate several waveform analysis methods, among which direct demodulation, convolutional neutron network~(CNN) and Bayesian matching persuit are the best.  Timing resolution is improved upon traditional thresholding method found in timing digital circuits, most significantly with high energy events when photoelectrons pile up in waveforms.
