Photomultiplier tube~(PMT) voltage waveforms are the raw data of many neutrino and dark matter experiments. Waveform analysis is usually the first critical step of data processing. Targeting precise time and charge extraction of photoelectrons, we generate the Monte Carlo samples based on detector response and evaluate several waveform analysis methods, among which direct demodulation, convolutional neural networks, and fast stochastic matching pursuits are the most promising. The results show an improvement on time and energy resolution upon the traditional thresholding methods, especially when photoelectrons pile up in waveforms.
