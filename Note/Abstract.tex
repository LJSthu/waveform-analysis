Research of events in neutrino and dark matter detectors based on PMTs rely on PMT waveform analysis, especially high energy events. Commonly, PhotoMultiplier Tubes (PMT) waveform analysis method records total charge and first hittime of photoelectrons (PE) which results in lost of full information. In this study, series of methods of waveform analysis were developed and tested. We use Wasserstein Distance as one of figures of merit to measure the difference between simulation truth and reconstruction results. The time resolution of PMT measurements will be improved by the optimization of waveform analysis methods.
